Hi, I’m Kyle Robinson, although I'm mostly called Kylo 👋 

## My Profession

My expertise is in all things Javascript.

I 💚 Javascript.

I am a full stack Javascript developer. I have worked on everything from component libraries, to high traffic landing pages, to PCI compliant payment pages, to Node JS backends. I am currently working as a React developer in Dubai, building dashboards and UIs for payment gateways.

My current side project is an interactive e-learning platform.

## Teaching Javascript

I am also a Javascript coach 👨‍🏫. 

I have taught many junior developers, and lead the current inhouse Javascript & React training program.

I teach the language visually, using story and abstracted imagery to explain complex JS topics. You can see my work here  👉 <https://thegreatsync.com/>
